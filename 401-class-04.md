## Reading 04

### Classes and Objects

> classes in python are groups of variables and functions

> objects get their variables and functions from classes

#### example
 - ` class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.") `

- ` myobjectx = myClass()`

- myobject.variable will be 'blah'

### Thinking recursively

- think of the base case or base bases for what you want to do then build from there

- can use globals to keep values from reseting on recall  did this for array search challenge

- data structures can be recursive if it can be defined in terms of smaller versions of its self

### fixtures

`@pytest.fixture
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))`
