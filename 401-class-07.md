# Game of Greed 2

## Python Scope and the LEGB Rule
 
 > **scope** rules how variables are looped up and the visibily of the variable within the code

> **Global scope**: names here are available to all of your code

> **Local scope**: names here are only available or visible the code within the scope


## Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope
  - > **Local** or function scope this scope contains what is defined inside the function and will only be visible inside the function

  - > **Enclosing scope** nonlocal is a specail scope that only exsists in nested functions

  - > **Global** module scope is the top scope  where variable are visible and usabale by everything

  - > ** Built in Scope** is a specail python scope thats loaded whenever you run a scrips this scope contains names like keywords functions and other built in attributes

  ## global statement
   - > using the **global keyword** inside a function will declare that variable in the global scope 

   `>>> counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter():
...     global counter  # Declare counter as global
...     counter = counter + 1  # Successfully update the counter
...
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
1
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
2
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
3
`

## nonlocal statement
 - > nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions but not assigned or updated(immutable) but when using the nonlocal keywords it lets you mutate the values 

 `>>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200
`
