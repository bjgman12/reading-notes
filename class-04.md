# Chapet 4 Links

> links are created using the `<a href>` tag placing the readabletext inbetween the opening and closing tag

- **Absolute Urls** use a sites domain name
- **Relative Urls** can use a shorthand to sites in the same location as the one being accessed

## Directory structure

> Directories for a web site are built in tree form

- The top level folder is called the root folder

- each section placed below is sectioned off to help organize filed each section having a index,html

- relative links can be used in the same folder or parent and child folders using basic director navigation



## Types of links

- Email links use ` <a href="mailto:emailaff>` to open the users default email program

- To open a link in a new window use `<a href="" target="_blank">`

- to link to a sepecific part of the same page you can set ids and then use the a tag to link to that id

- to do this to another page simply link to the page and add the `#id ` to the end of the link

## Layout

- block level elements start on a new line
- Inline elements flow inbetween surrounding text

- if one element sits inside of another the one containing the other is known as the parent

### Positioning

- **Normal Flow** every block element appears on a new line

- **Realative positioning** moves element from normal position shifting it to a side of where it originally would have been

- **Absolute Positioning** object is taken out of normal flow and is not affected by other elements

- **Fixed Positioning** a type if absolute positioning where position is set relative to the browser window

- **Floating elements** allow you to take object out of normal flow and place it to the far left or right of its containing box

## Functions

-Functions have two parts a decleration to set the instructions and a call to use the function


## Pair programing

- two parts **Driver** and **Navigator** one does the actual code and the other guides with ideas and concepts
