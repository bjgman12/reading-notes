## Testing and Modules

> Example test

- `def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():    detector = GenderDetector()    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Ana’)    assert expected_gender == ‘female’ `

> test names should be descriptive and what what is expected and what we are testing

> test file name should folow the same naming convention as the module name so for example **gender.py** test name should be **test-gender.py**

>structure of the test is also important you should follow this convention

- **Arrange** organize the data.
- **Act** execute the code being tested
- **Assert** after executing check the result 

### The Cycle 

- write the test , and it should fail no code is present
- write the feature and make the test pass
- refactor the code to make it pretty

> after making the initail test pass you can add to the test for other functionality or deeper functionality then  change the codce as needed taking baby steps to get to where you want the final product to be.

### Take aways


- code is more reliable with tests
- it will come with practice

## Recursion 

- recursion is the proccess that a function will call itself directly or indirectly.

in recursion the base case problem is solved and the solution of the larger problem is expressed in fragments

`int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}`

> recursion can be either direct or indirect  in direct recursion the function will only call itself in indirect recursion the function will call another function that will in turn call it back
